# Histolines shared thousands of historical images from The Art Institute of Chicago

Histolines organized and shared over 27K thousands of artwork images from <a href="https://www.artic.edu/">The Art Institute of Chicago</a> to our interactive historical timeline of events, and images.

These images were released under <a href="https://www.artic.edu/image-licensing"> Open Access Images Licensing</a>. Histolines build natural language crawlers that pick out names, locations, and dates in the image description to organize them in timelines.

These images have enriched the <a href="http://histolines.com/timeline_character.php?charname=Vincent+van+Gogh"> timelines of Vincent van Gogh</a> ,<a href="http://histolines.com/timeline_character.php?charname=Edgar+Degas"> Edgar Degas</a>, <a href="http://histolines.com/timeline_character.php?charname=Henri+de+Toulouse-Lautrec"> Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</a>, and thousands of other artists to help us get a complete understanding of their life and creative development.
